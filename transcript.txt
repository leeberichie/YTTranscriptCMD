 it's January here on YouTube so you know
 exactly what that means compilation
 videos from the previous year people
 putting the current year in their video
 titles and just hoping that does
 something and most importantly channels
 and videos about self-improvement and
 motivation are having an absolute field
 day and I can't stand it the self-help
 industry was valued at over $40 billion
 in 2023 and that number is expected to
 double by 2032 I'm sure you've seen some
 videos or books in the genre you know
 what it's like they make it seem so easy
 as if all your dreams are just a few
 minutes and or Pages away lies they did
 this one thing they changed their life
 forever they make up buzzword they all
 pay the same set designer and editor and
 if you buy their mentorship book course
 program then all your dreams will come
 true you do it and then nothing changes
 if you couldn't tell by now I'm mad and
 we're going to spend the next 15 to 20
 minutes talking about
 [Music]
 it whether it's a self-help book video
 guide seminar or course every time you
 buy into one of these things somebody is
 profiting off of your discontentment in
 life technically I'm doing it right now
 now I'm not saying every time this
 happens it is always being done
 maliciously I from One have a lot of
 self-help channels and creators that I
 really like on mental health and fiscal
 responsibility and having a social life
 and a bunch of other things and I
 personally would like to say that my
 videos are made with the intention of
 being entertaining and helpful first and
 I hope that's the vibe that you get as
 well I'm just saying this so you can
 understand your role in this transaction
 so you can understand how easy it would
 be be to take advantage of that because
 it is very easy for a Creator or
 self-proclaimed entrepreneur to come in
 with not so great motives try and take
 advantage of your discontent and unhappy
 feelings and make a quick Buck off you
 you don't need a degree to be one of
 these guys you can kind of just say do
 or look any way you want on the internet
 and no one can really prove you wrong
 it's pretty great and by that I mean I'm
 lying it's terrible see lying on the
 internet I just did it let's just for
 the sake of argument assume that all of
 these guys are 100% legitimate even if
 that were the case I would still still
 have one big issue with them and to be
 honest fair warning this is going to be
 a bit of a nonsensical argument but this
 is my video and I get to say whatever I
 want and I will gladly do so why do all
 these guys have their lives together
 like at least some of them have to
 actually be as successful as they claim
 to be and that is genuinely upsetting to
 me case in point have you ever seen any
 of Ali ABD dal's videos that man
 stresses me out within the span of 20
 minutes this man will talk about
 everything he has done is doing and will
 do constantly and forever like in
 researching this video I watched one of
 his videos just to kind of get a feel
 for this whole self-help space and
 within it couldn't have been without 5
 minutes every time 5 minutes had passed
 he would break whatever he was talking
 about to plug something else whether
 it's a course a boot camp a sponsor this
 man does everything why why Ali why are
 you doing this you've done all the stuff
 you've won the game who is this even for
 anymore who becomes a doctor and then
 decides no that was too easy let's
 instead do every other Venture on the
 face of the planet this man uses all 27
 hours of a 24-hour day meanwhile I spent
 the last 3 hours watching YouTube shorts
 on this couch while procrastinating
 writing the script do I remember even
 10% of those videos that I watched in
 that 3 hours no shame on you Ali shame I
 said I could never interrupt a video
 meant for the benefit of the People by
 including a sponsorship in the middle in
 the that that's no you know where this
 is going right please watch it I have
 bills man this video is sponsored by
 Aura hi I'm 11 I just discovered the
 internet and it's crazy I'm going to
 sign up for a bunch of services and
 accounts right now which is a decision
 I'm sure I never regret he was wrong I
 did indeed regret it I've made many
 accounts in my day many of which I
 forgotten about for example I made one
 with this math website while I was in
 Middle School using an email and
 password I still use today the company
 had a data leak that my password was a
 part of which I would have never known
 about if it weren't for Aura Aura is the
 all-in-one service that you need to
 secure you and your family's online
 activities data breaches like the one I
 was a part of make you more susceptible
 to identity theft fraud and scams they
 can have info like your full name
 address date of birth phone numbers and
 even your social security number just
 out in the open really I didn't mean to
 cause you all that trouble I'm sorry a
 that's okay you stupid dumb idiot Hey
 cuz thanks to Aura they can scan the
 internet and see if your information is
 anywhere it shouldn't be and if it is

 helping the channel and you'll protect
 yourself online everyone wins except for
 you you little stinker why are you so
 mean to meop it you look dumb why do you
 have a beard you're 11 getting back to
 what I was saying I understand that
 that's a really weird thing to complain
 about that people trying to help others
 get their lives together themselves have
 their life together I understand that
 that's that's kind of silly the only
 reason I'm saying this is because even
 though it makes sense for them to do it
 it kind of is still adding to the whole
 idea that whenever you go on social
 media it's bad for you because it makes
 you feel like everyone else has their
 lives in order and you don't you want to
 talk about feeling bad cuz other people
 are doing better than you these guys are
 leagues ahead of me the the contrast
 alone of their productivity versus my
 productivity is is either hilarious or
 deeply upsetting I I choose both and to
 see these self-help people so constantly
 and consistently portray themselves this
 way even if it's not true it's still
 discouraging sometimes because if you're
 anything like me you watch them and you
 just think to yourself wow I will never
 be that guy so why should I even try
 however I do fully understand that there
 are people who look at them even though
 they are leagues ahead of them and see
 it as an inspiration that they could one
 day attain to that level and for those
 people I am happy for them because it's
 true in a lot of ways but take it with a
 grain of salts because for every legit
 person on the internet offering Sound
 Advice that you can actually apply in
 your life there are 10 other creators
 who are just spewing nonsense and it
 annoys me so much for example why do a
 lot of these self-help gurus use
 absolutes and explain very basic things
 that as if they're revolutionary it's
 always this is the one thing you need to
 be a millionaire you will never fail if
 you try this your father will love you
 if you use these hacks all of those
 statements were lies they always trying
 to make their advice seem so fancy and
 mind-blowing it's not it's actually very
 common knowledge Andor practice for
 example consider the following excert
 step five surround yourself with the
 right people here's the truth no one
 talks about your environment will either
 push you forward or pull you down the
 people you spend time with your friends
 family colleagues have a massive impact
 on your success the secret that nobody
 talks about is that the people you
 surround yourself with will have an
 impact on the person you
 become the secret no one's ever heard of
 before that that's it I'm not going to
 say anything else about that I'm just
 going to trust that you understand how
 frustrating that is and why it is so I
 will say this though oddly enough enough
 I think Newton's first law Falls in this
 category for those of you who don't know
 Isaac Newton the father of modern
 physics his first law things don't move
 unless you move them and they don't stop
 unless you stop them I dare one of you
 physics nerds to tell me otherwise it's
 so stupid no am I saying these self-help
 gurus keep things intentionally surface
 level and vague so they can appeal to
 the least common denominator or am I
 saying that doing this makes Their
 audience feel like they're changing
 whether or not they actually are or am I
 even saying that doing this can subtly
 make Their audience feel inferior so
 that they now depend on them to feel
 good again I never said any of those
 things why would you say
 that now I want to emphasize that this
 is my personal opinion but if I had to
 sum up the effect that this has on
 culture and Society it would come to two
 main
 categories what's interesting about
 self-help is that it doesn't actually
 have to change you it just has to make
 you feel that you're changing you just
 want to feel good about yourself and
 that you're in control of your life and
 you know what that looks like we've all
 gone to a Barnes and no wanted to change
 our life see a book that's for some
 reason
 cost
 $31 and then once you justify that high
 price to yourself then you start to
 think wow am I better than everyone else
 I'm being so responsible like I bought a
 book by myself for fun am I some kind of
 genius and then at that point you may as
 well Chuck the book into oncoming
 traffic you you'll never know what it
 says either way you're not actually
 going to read it if you really wanted to
 learn that skill you could have easily
 Googled it watch one of those good
 self-help video guys there are probably
 a bunch of podcasts on it and honestly
 you can ask chat gbt to make you a
 research plan on a bunch of Articles
 videos and podcast to do the thing there
 are a lot of free sources you could be
 using but since they are free they don't
 feel as official you know but buying a
 book like a real one that's made on
 paper with money now that's changed but
 even if you did go the free route doing
 too much research with articles and
 videos can be its own form of
 procrastination and it's a tricky one at
 that cuz at least when you're watching
 Instagram reals you know you're not
 being productive and maybe you'll start
 feeling bad after an hour or two or
 seven and then you'll eventually get the
 Tas started but when you're doing
 research you feel like you're being
 productive and so you feel good about
 yourself and while it is good you
 shouldn't feel you shouldn't feel like
 that good yet you haven't done anything
 and it comes to a certain point where
 you have enough information you you need
 to stop reading and actually do it and
 if you pass that point and continue to
 read articles you are now delaying your
 progress and that's why it's tricky
 because now you don't even fully realize
 that you're procrastinating even though
 you definitely are you know in many ways
 this type of procrastination is actually
 worse than the Instagram type of
 procrastination because at least then
 you could have argued well hey I don't
 really know how to start that's why I
 haven't done anything yet but now you've
 done the research you know exactly how
 to start you're just choosing not to
 like you're doing all this extra
 research you're gaining nothing for it
 and you're wasting hours you could have
 just spent those wasted hours doing
 something that you actually enjoyed like
 mindlessly watching Instagram reals
 what's the moral of the story planning
 and researching is pointless and you
 should just watch Instagram
 yep that'll do
 it you know like I was going to do a
 joke where I I like put in the yeah
 sound yeah that sound I think it might
 be funnier if I just leave the the if I
 think editing me might leave that in
 that would be really the fact of the
 matter is doing the thing is scary it
 makes you feel untalented and stupid and
 slow and no matter what amount of
 research you do you can never fully get
 rid of this feeling but hey watch
 another video on time management listen
 to your motivation playlist again buy a
 third planner I'm sure that doing all of
 these things will definitely help us
 achieve our goals and make us happier in
 the long
 run you can see that right it's yeah
 yeah I'm sure okay
 the contrast between motivational and
 self-help content intended for men and
 women should be studied because it is so
 interesting I did a tad bit of research
 for this subject so I'm happy to report
 my observations I saw that the content
 typically intended for the female
 audience is colorful known for its
 variety of planners and stationary they
 focus on a hope for a better future
 being what's known as an IT girl and for
 some reason all their thumbnails follow
 the same theme of fitting an entire
 camera roll worth of photos into one
 frame now I personally find it to be a
 bit vague and overly op optimistic but I
 am Charmed at the joy that this seems to
 instill in these women even if the joy
 is as short-lived as the goals
 themselves it's still nice the men
 however hey guys let's talk according to
 my research on men's motivation content
 you're supposed to be sad angry and
 staring into the abyss for about 90% of
 your day they're also mostly comprised
 of stock footage and clips from movies
 and also just Ryan Gosling in general I
 don't know why they picked him to be the
 mascot but he's there a lot and then
 after that all packaged with a title
 that has the word motivation somewhere
 in it and then the most uncomfortably
 detailed thumbnail you have ever seen in
 your entire life that
 is ew sorry sir and let me just say
 something real quick um this isn't as
 cool as as you might think it is like
 this picture looks cool but like it
 doesn't look cool just because the man
 is so cool it's because someone took the
 time to set up a light to get that
 shadow in addition someone also spent a
 lot of time bent over on a laptop
 editing this photo so it could look that
 way do do you get the point I'm making
 here it looks this way not because the
 dude just has that air to him no it's
 because some nerd who's really good with
 cameras lights and editing took a lot of
 time to make him look that way like you
 know the jokes where it's like bro had
 to set up the tripod and yeah that
 that's literally what's happening here
 it's not that cool once you think about
 it why is the internet convinced that
 the only way for a man to improve is to
 cut off everyone they love and hold dear
 lock themselves in a room with no
 natural sunlight and stay there until
 they become I don't even I don't even
 know what the goal is really like you
 want to be a a business guy of of some
 sort it's never anything specific it's
 always just like a man in a suit with
 money where do you get the suit from
 where's the money from they don't they
 don't care in addition there is
 something about self-help that just
 encourages an unhealthy level of
 individualism you're supposed to help
 yourself just read more books you should
 be able to fix all your problems by
 yourself without the help of anyone else
 and if you can't you're a loser and you
 should feel bad and that's exactly why
 you should buy my book can you see it
 the most with like male intended
 motivation you have to be a lone wolf
 figure it out all by yourself it should
 be Agony you should love the pain and
 discomfort because that's what a hunter
 and a warrior would do you have to be a
 machine brother you live in a home with
 steady Wi-Fi and air conditioning you
 are none of those things you no hey look
 at me you no what honor and nobility do
 you think you are gaining by cutting off
 the outside world and pushing away
 everyone who loves you what trophies do
 you earn what accolades have you
 achieved why are you even doing this
 because some guy took an AI voice mixed
 together with clips of movies made 20
 years ago and told you that you should
 do it that is the corniest thing I have
 ever heard and you're supposed to be a
 warrior your favorite movie is Wall-E
 but I'm not going to fully bash these
 videos because if you look at the guys
 they use as examples in these
 motivational videos they are far more
 driven than I am they all have more
 money and more worldly accomplishments
 than I will ever have have and I think
 it's only fair and necessary to
 acknowledge at least that but with that
 being said I'm still hypercritical of
 these videos because I don't love the
 mindset that they encourage the idea
 that you're so much better than the
 average person and the only thing
 stopping you from succeeding is your
 hard work everyone else in your life is
 a distraction because they will never
 understand this enlightened path you
 have chosen to take I think when you
 take this to extremes this type of
 thinking only leads to narcissism and
 thinking that you're more important and
 self-sufficient than you actually are
 because you do not by yourself have
 everything you need to succeed if you
 read books watch videos consult
 professionals that is you admitting that
 you need the help of other people if you
 want to improve and get better you don't
 just innately have the knowhow you have
 to learn just like everybody else
 therefore you are not just so much
 smarter than everyone else also you can
 work really hard and still fail it
 happens all the time now am I saying
 that you shouldn't work hard because
 there's no guarantee of success no of
 course of course not but if you put your
 entire self-worth into the result of
 your hard work what happens when a
 hurricane comes in and throws that hard
 work aunder you're going to will it back
 into existence by the means of your
 mindset no sometimes it'll fail and if
 that was the only thing you had in your
 life I can only imagine how that would
 crush you things happen success is never
 guaranteed you will need help from
 others in literally everything you do
 for the
 99.999% of people watching this which
 spoiler alert probably includes you you
 are not
 special and that's totally
 fine again the following is my personal
 opinions and feelings and experiences on
 this topic if none of this works for you
 that's totally okay there are multiple
 valid ways to approach this something I
 read on Reddit that I think is true for
 this topic is that it's difficult to
 make conscious change because your brain
 has so many subconscious programs it's
 one thing to know that you have to
 change that's the easy part but training
 your brain to actually adopt the change
 is an uphill battle because it's so used
 to just turning off and doing the
 default option for example have you ever
 found yourself using Instagram for hours
 and then you try and be a responsible
 adult and then you leave the app and
 then within literally 10 seconds you
 open the app again I don't even think
 about it when it happens it just it just
 happens it is a subconscious process
 that I have to consciously force myself
 out of and honestly I don't always
 succeed I have been on Instagram so many
 times while making this video so
 whenever I'm trying to make a really big
 change I have to have a really good
 reason and it needs to be as
 frictionless as possible when compared
 to my current programs this is why a lot
 of the time when I set a goal I don't
 have a specific deadline in mind now
 this may sound a bit counterintuitive
 but hear me out for those of you who
 don't know I go to the gym do you know
 why I started doing that because my
 doctor told me I was going to die okay
 fine that's not exactly what he said he
 said something more along the lines of I
 don't mean to alarm you but your family
 has a history of diabetes and high blood
 pressure so you're really going to want
 to be careful with some of these habits
 you know like right now you're
 considered obese and we just got your
 blood work back and it's looking like
 you're pre-diabetic but what I heard was
 hey Fatso this chart says you got like
 two months left tops I said interesting
 very interesting so did I want to change
 how I at and start working out no but
 what was I going to do die I got a gym
 membership that day and I've gone
 consistently two or three days a week
 for the past 3 years so dear viewer what
 do you think it was that motivated me to
 go to the gym was is it that I wrote
 down inspirational quotes on a
 whiteboard and also sticky notes on my
 mirror or was it the morbid fear of
 succumbing to an untimely painful and
 preventable death wherein my last cold
 artery clogged breath would be me saying
 I should have it was option b now am I
 saying that you too must eat yourself to
 the brink of type 2 diabetes in order to
 lock in that is one strategy but not one
 I could honestly recommend no what I'm
 saying is that at least for me change
 doesn't come just because I like really
 want it comes because I reach a point
 where I think to myself what else am I
 going to do when I started going to the
 gym it wasn't an issue of whether I
 wanted to or not there were no planners
 no deadlines no choice I don't have a
 choice we're going like yeah so maybe I
 missed a day or messed up in some other
 way who cares we can't stop doing it we
 have we keep going also again in my
 experience a goal for me only works when
 I don't feel that I'm trying to change
 the world overnight I have to accept
 that this is going to be an imperfect
 process I'm going going to miss days I'm
 going to make rookie mistakes for weeks
 at a time that is going to delay my
 progress it's not going to be fun this
 is this is how it works you are going to
 feel like an idiot and a failure and
 that you're behind the entire time it's
 part of the process realistic goals are
 not flashy they are a boring slog that
 takes a a million different Tiny Steps
 to lead to One Big Goal those Tiny Steps
 are going to feel like mountains to you
 but nobody else is going to care about
 them and while we're talking about not
 being perfect do you realize that I suck
 too I from time to time will make advice
 videos and even I don't perfectly follow
 them there are still days where I spend
 half my time wasted on my phone
 criticism is not always easy to take I
 compare myself to people all the time
 and most frustratingly I got the volume
 two loud notification today and I was
 doing really good with that one but am I
 saying that I learned nothing from
 researching and writing those videos of
 course not anytime I'm indulging in
 these activities I think back on the
 work that I did and how it's on the
 internet right now and how if I don't
 apply it I'm being a hypocrite so yes
 there have been steady improvements I
 still regularly check my volume levels
 to make sure they're not too loud I
 Journal so that I can take criticism
 better and stop comparing as much and
 I'm happy to report that as far as the
 phone thing goes incidents have gone
 down from happening 19 days a month to
 about 13 days a month which if you
 haven't noticed is a smaller number I'm
 just saying this so you don't think that
 I'm perfect and that I have my life in
 order no oh that's so no that's part of
 the reason why I try and keep these
 videos a little bit relatable and also
 as chaotic as humanly possible I think
 there's something really funny about the
 ju's position of making wellth thought
 out and nuanced arguments while using
 big people smart words such as nuanced
 and ju toos all the while contrasting it
 with filming on a green screen held
 together by paint cans a bed with no
 sheets my mother's weirdly fancy couch
 and other miscellaneous areas that make
 guest appearances every now and then and
 of course an unexplained hole in the
 wall stop asking me in the comments I
 will never tell you how this happened
 never and that's honestly how I get like
 90% n of these video ideas like I'll see
 a bad habit in myself or I'll see a bad
 habit in somebody else that I can
 somewhat relate to and then I this will
 give me an excuse to research it for
 like a week it is definitely not because
 I have mastered these subjects and I
 feel that I am qualified to teach it to
 others you should view me less as a
 teacher in the scenario and more as a
 seventh grader giving a book report I'm
 simply sharing some things that I found
 and liked with my fellow seventh graders
 and also during the question and answer
 section if you ask me something even a
 little bit out of the scope of my
 research I will Panic real quick
 addressing the whole male loneliness
 move in the shadows lock yourself in a
 basement for 7 months until you emerge
 looking like handsome Squidward let's
 talk about that for a second while I do
 think it's important to have a level of
 privacy in your life and there are
 definitely times where you do have to
 sit down and lock in consider this one
 of my biggest not going to kill me fears
 is an empty photo album I hate the
 thought that I could very easily spend
 all my time alone and then one day I'll
 be 50 and want to reminisce on old
 memories but I can't because I never
 took pictures pictur of anything because
 I never had a reason to take pictures of
 anything because I didn't spend time
 with anyone whether it was because I
 thought I was too good or too bad to
 have friends whatever the reason I don't
 want to be that I don't want to look
 back on myself and have nothing no
 reason for pictures no memories with
 people I loved that's just sad career
 goals and personal achievements are
 important in life but they're not the
 only thing in life and doing that sure
 you may have a lot of accolade
 achievements and be able to buy a bunch
 of cool things but a bunch of pictures
 of trophies is a really boring photo
 album self-improvement is a good thing
 there is a certain pride in being able
 to look at a to-do list with every item
 checked off and to look at oneself in
 the mirror and say I didn't waste the
 whole day watching Instagram reals What
 A Lovely feeling that is we're all
 lacking in some way and as long as we're
 trying to do something to improve that
 lack we're doing something right and
 also I enjoy making these videos and I'm
 definitely not going to stop doing it
 but please remember I'm not an expert in
 anything I say I'm just a curious
 seventh grader do we like these new
 glasses I think they're cool
